Comparative Analysis of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Across Countries and Continents for 2021
​The investigation of COVID-19 cases and fatalities across various continents and nations is the main focus of this endeavor. The goal is to gain understanding of the pandemic's patterns and trends, comprehend the variances in the virus's propagation among different places, and investigate the effects of various elements on transmission and mortality rates. We seek to solve the following critical issues using freely accessible COVID-19 datasets, statistical analysis methods, and data visualization tools: Comparative Analysis We shall evaluate the daily new cases and fatalities in a few picked regions and continents. This research will give a thorough picture of the pandemic's effects across all locations and aid in locating any notable variances. Statistical Analysis To ascertain whether there are appreciable variations in the mean number of monthly new cases among the chosen nations, we will run statistical tests like ANOVA. This will enable us to determine whether some nations or areas had noticeably higher or lower transmission rates. Analysis of Regression We will investigate the connection between the population of each nation and the rate at which new cases are increasing. By using a linear regression analysis, we can determine whether there is a relationship between these variables and learn more about how the size of the population may affect how the virus spreads. Visualization of data We will use a variety of visualizations, including line graphs, bar charts, box plots, and regression plots, to clearly describe the results. The trends, patterns, and correlations in the data will be easier to understand thanks to these visual representations. The goal of this study is to advance knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic by revealing important details about the variances in cases and fatalities across regions and continents. We can generate actionable information from the data analysis and result interpretation that may help researchers, politicians, and healthcare professionals make wise decisions and develop ways to effectively combat the virus.​​​

Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from the following:​COVID-19 daily data: Worldometer Coronavirus Daily Data COVID-19 summary data: Worldometer Coronavirus Summary Data Population data: World Bank Population Data

Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:​Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt Run the main script: python analysis.py

Method
Data Cleaning: The raw COVID-19 data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and inconsistencies. Data Analysis: Various descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis techniques were used to understand the data. Statistical Testing: Statistical tests such as ANOVA were performed to compare mean values and assess significance. Visualization: Data was visualized using matplotlib to create charts and plots for better understanding. Regression Analysis: Linear regression analysis was conducted to explore relationships between variables. ANOVA Testing: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare mean values across multiple groups.

Result and Analysis
box_df = merged_df[merged_df['country'].isin(country_list)]

Create a boxplot to compare means
box_df.boxplot('daily_new_cases', by='country', figsize=(15, 10))

Set labels and title
plt.ticklabel_format(style='plain', axis='y') plt.xlabel('Country') plt.ylabel('Monthly Cases') plt.title('Comparison of Monthly Cases by Country')

Show the plot
plt.savefig("output_data/Fig4.png", bbox_inches='tight') plt.show()​Comparative Analysis: Significant variations in daily new cases and deaths were observed across countries and continents.

Perform t-test to compare mean monthly new cases between two countries
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind​country1_cases = merged_df[merged_df["country"] == "France"]["daily_new_cases"] country2_cases = merged_df[merged_df["country"] == "Russia"]["daily_new_cases"] t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(country1_cases, country2_cases)​

Print the test result
print("T-Statistic:", t_statistic) print("P-Value:", p_value)​T-Statistic: 0.0769452772096377 P-Value: 0.9393625741104167​#ANOVA testing​

Extract the cases data for each country
data = [] for c in country_list: data.append(merged_df[merged_df["country"] == c]["daily_new_cases"])​statistic, p_value = f_oneway(*data)​

Print the results
print(f"The statistic value is: {statistic}") print(f"The P-Value is: {p_value}") The statistic value is: 13.435378940094392 The P-Value is: 4.897637738181195e-09​#Null Hypothesis H0: There is no significant difference in the mean number of monthly new cases among the selected countries.​#Alternate Hypothesis H1: There is a significant difference in the mean number of monhtly cases among the the selected countries.​#we can infer that there are significant differences in the daily new cases among the countries. #The low P-value suggests that the observed differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. #Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are statistically significant differences in #the mean monhtly cases among the countries.​​Statistical Testing: t test revealed significant differences in mean monthly new cases among the selected countries.​##Regression Analysis #linear regression test to see the relaitonship between increase rate and population by_country = by_country[by_country['% Death Rate']!= np.inf] death_r = by_country["% Death Rate"] increase_r = by_country["Increase Rate"] (slope, intercept, rvalue, pvalue, stderr) = linregress(increase_r, death_r) regress_values = increase_r * slope + intercept line_eq = "y = " + str(round(slope,2)) + "x " + str(round(intercept,2)) plt.scatter(increase_r, death_r) plt.xlabel("Increase Rate of New Cases") plt.ylabel("% Death Rate") plt.title("Linear Regression analysis between Increase rate and % Death rate") plt.plot(increase_r,regress_values,"r-") plt.annotate(line_eq,(6,10),fontsize=15,color="red") plt.savefig("output_data/Fig5.png", bbox_inches='tight') print(f'The r-value is: {rvalue}')​​

Conclusion
With its insightful analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's global effects, this research advances knowledge of the disease. The results can promote the creation of measures to reduce the spread of the infection and can help decision-making processes. It is crucial to remember that the analysis has limitations due to the use of limited data, including data accuracy and reporting inconsistencies. The COVID-19 and population datasets were generously provided by the World Bank and Worldometer, respectively. Their efforts in gathering and storing this data have significantly advanced knowledge of the epidemic and study into it.
